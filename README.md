# Car Resale Value Prediction
## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Car Dekho, company is facing the challenge of accurately predicting the resale value of used cars based on the provided dataset. The resale value of a used car depends on various factors such as the car's age, mileage, condition, fuel type, and other specifications. Accurately estimating the selling price of a used car is crucial for attracting potential buyers and providing fair deals to both sellers and buyers on the Car Dekho platform.

## **OBJECTIVE**

The objective of this project is to develop an advanced and accurate resale value prediction model for used cars on the Car Dekho platform. The primary goal is to leverage the provided dataset and conduct in-depth analysis to understand the factors that influence the resale value of used cars. Based on these insights, the project aims to create a robust and reliable model that can predict the selling price of used cars more accurately.

## **Research Questions**

❖ How does the age (year) of the car influence its selling price?

❖ What is the correlation between the distance covered (km_driven) by a car and its selling price?

❖ Does the type of fuel (petrol, diesel, CNG, etc.) impact the selling price of cars?

❖ What is the effect of the seller type (individual, dealer) on the selling price of cars?

❖ Does the number of previous owners (owner) impact the resale value of a car? Are single-owner cars more desirable to buyers, resulting in a higher selling price?

## **ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS**

### 1. How does the age (year) of the car influence its selling price?

The graph clearly illustrates a strong negative correlation between the age of the car and its selling price. As the car's age increases, the selling price tends to decrease. Conversely, as the car's age decreases, the selling price tends to increase. This indicates that older cars generally have a lower resale value compared to newer ones.

### 2. What is the correlation between the distance covered (km_driven) by a car and its selling price?

This correlation suggests that there is a weak negative relationship between the number of kilometres driven and the selling price of used cars. As the kilometres driven increase, there is a slight tendency for the selling price to decrease slightly. However, the correlation is not strong, meaning that the influence of kilometres driven on the selling price is not very pronounced.

### 3. Does the type of fuel (petrol, diesel, CNG, etc.) impact the selling price of cars?

This graph suggests that electric cars tend to have the highest average selling price, followed by diesel, petrol, CNG, and LPG cars.

### 4. What is the effect of the seller type (individual, dealer) on the selling price of cars?

The analysis reveals that the average selling price of cars is highest for dealers, followed by Trustmark dealers, and then individual sellers. Dealerships' higher prices may be attributed to professional services and added value, while individual sellers' lower prices could be due to more competitive pricing and fewer services offered. Seller type significantly influences the selling price in the used car market.

### 5. Does the number of previous owners (owner) impact the resale value of a car? Are single-owner cars more desirable to buyers, resulting in a higher selling price?

The resale value of used cars is influenced by the number of previous owners. Test drive cars have the highest average selling price, likely due to being newer, having lower mileage, and potentially being covered under warranties, making them attractive to buyers. First owner cars come next with a higher resale value as they are often well-maintained
and instil buyer confidence. Second owner cars have a slightly lower average selling price but are still relatively well-maintained. However, as the number of previous owners increases, the average selling price declines, with third owner cars having a lower resale value. Cars with four or more previous owners have the lowest average selling price, which could be attributed to perceived wear and tear, leading to buyer caution in such cases.
